All the steps that I have done during the task:

1. grouping the data order status wise.
2. Finding the total cost price and total final price for each status using sumifs.
3. finding the total profit by substracting only delivered products cost price from total final price.
4. By adding all the values of final settlement price  we will get our total payment received for entire month.
5. Then I created a pivot table by grouping SKUs and added 2 columns cost price and final price for each sku groups.
6. Substracting cost price from final price product wise I am getting my profitability for each product.
7. Dividing sum of final price state wise/order status wise from total payment received for entire month we will get our sales % for each state.
8. Other Metrics:
	 
	a. Average order value --> We can find average order value by dividing (total payment received / total number of order received)
	b. we can also find percentage of each order staus by (number of orders in each status / total number of orders).
		 so we got return rate = 6.45%
			   Cancelled rate = 1.08%
